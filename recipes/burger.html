<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Burger patty between doughnut halves. </p>
<p>Serve with ketchup, honey mustard, and pepper sauce, if desired.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>6 slices bacon, or more to taste</li>
	<li>1 large onion</li>
	<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
	<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
	<li>2 large eggs</li>
	<li>1.5 teaspoons rum</li>
	<li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
	<li>6 large doughnut (4" dia)s cake doughnuts, halved</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until dry and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels. Remove most of the bacon grease from the skillet.</li>
	<li>Cut onion into 6 slices. Cook in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove from the heat.</li>
	<li>While the onion is cooking, season beef with salt and pepper. Mix to combine and divide into 6 equal portions. Form into meatballs, then use a spatula or patty mold to shape meatballs into patties.</li>
	<li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
	<li>While the oil is heating, mix eggs and rum together in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper, if desired. Dip patties into the egg mixture and place directly in the hot oil. Fry patties until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Drain patties on paper towels.</li>
	<li>Compile burgers on doughnut halves with bacon and onions.</li>
</ol>
